def faq_tps():

	TPS (Transactions Per Second) is not a useful metric. On Ergo Reference Node v.5, TPS is estimated to be a minimum of 47.5 tx/s. However, transactions can happen in three scaling layers or levels: 

L0: Ergo Reference Nodes, which can be bootstrapped using NiPoPoWs proofs and UTXO set snapshots. 
L1: Ergo has extensions that allow for a wide variety of scaling solutions such as Sharding, Hydra, or BitcoinNG-style macroblocks. 
L2 (off-chain): Ergo should be compatible with the Lightning Network, Rainbow Network, and many more. The implementation here will depend on the needs of the applications being built on Ergo.

The general idea is that many transactions can happen in L1 or L2 and these transactions can be bundled and settled on the L0 layer of the Ergo blockchain using a single transaction. Thanks to the high flexibility of ErgoScript programming model, many different protocols are possible, each one solving scalability problem in a specific domain (like simple payment transactions).

Ergo blockchain can be thought as common settlement layer for many L1/L2 protocols and applications.
