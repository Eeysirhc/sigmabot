        Ergo's TPS (Transactions per second) on the version 5 Node TPS is estimated to be a minimum of 47.5tx/s. There are three scaling layers or levels: L0: Ergo nodes, which can be bootstrapped using NiPoPoWs proofs and UTXO set snapshots are planned. L1: Ergo has an extension section in its code that allows the implementation of a wide variety of scaling solutions such as Sharding, Hydra, or BitcoinNG-style macroblocks. L2 (off-chain): Ergo should be compatible with the Lightning Network, Rainbow Network, and many more. The implementation here will depend on the needs of the applications being built on Ergo.

The general idea, roughtly, is that large chunks of transactions can happen in layer 2 and the whole chunks will be settled in Ergo blockchain using single transaction. Thanks to the high flexibility of ErgoScript programming model, many different protocols will be possible on layer2, each one solving scalability problem in a specific domain (like simple payment transactions).

Thus, Ergo blockchain can be thought as common settlement layer for many L2 protocols and applications.
