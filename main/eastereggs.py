##### WHY #####
why_responses = {
"pow": """Every blockchain solution requires a careful consideration of costs, benefits and risks. Blockchains are a big tent. There is room for everyone. However, PoW NIPoPows and chain-specific features like storage rent offers unique functionality that can be worth the extra energy expenditure of PoW for some blockchain uses.

"change": """To absorb more fundamental changes, Ergo follows the approach of soft-forkability that allows changing the protocol significantly while keeping old nodes operational. At the beginning of an epoch, a miner can also propose to vote for a more fundamental change (e.g., adding a new instruction to ErgoScript) describing affected validation rules. Voting for such breaking changes continues for 32,768 blocks and requires at least 90%  votes to be accepted. Once being accepted, a 32,768-blocks long activation period starts to give outdated nodes time to update their software version. If a node software is still not updated after the activation period, then it skips the specified checks but continues to validate all the known rules. List of previous soft-fork changes is recorded into the extension to allow light nodes of any software version to join the network and catch up to the current validation rules. A combination of soft-forkability with the voting protocol allows changing of almost all the parameters of the network except the PoW rules that are responsible for the voting itself."
